    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem given was the following : we want to set up an indoor location system, like an indoor GPS. In this project we will focus on computing the error of detection of the position of a moving object. Thus, we have the trajectory that the object is supposed to follow and the one that the location system says it has followed. The goal is to compute the error of detected trajectory. The given result should be the ratio between the area between the two trajectories, and the length of the theoretical path.\n",

    "- change of segment in the theoretical trajectory\n",
    "- intersection of the theoretical and experimental trajectories\n",
    "- reach a _vertex_ in the experimental trajectory\n",

    "When two points from the experimental and theoretical trajectories are equal, the area is a triangle. \n",
